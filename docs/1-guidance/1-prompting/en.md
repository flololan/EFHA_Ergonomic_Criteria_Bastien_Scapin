# Prompting

## Definition

As it is used here, Prompting has a broader definition than usual. Here it refers to the means available in order to lead the users to making specific actions whether it be data entry or other tasks. This criterion also refers to all the means that help users to know the alternatives when several actions are possible depending on the contexts. Prompting also concerns status information, that is information about the actual state or context of the system, as well as information concerning help facilities and their accessibility.
